# xPass - A TUI password manager written in Rust.

## Is it usable?
Well, the project itself is mostly done, and it is kind of usable, but the code is a bloated mess (I'm still learning the language, sorry about that :trollface:), so I'd still wait a while before giving it a try.

I'll be refactoring the code as I learn.

**Note: my code sucks!**
